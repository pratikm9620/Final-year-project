What is CBIS?

A Computer-Based Information System (CBIS) is a set of interconnected components working together to collect,
process, store, and distribute information to support decision-making, coordination, control, analysis, and
visualization in an organization.A computer-based information system is a technologically implemented medium
for recording, storing, and disseminating linguistic expressions, and for drawing conclusions from such 
expressions (Langefors, 1973).
These systems are designed to store and process information within organizations and usually consist of interrelated components that work
together to collect, process, store, and disseminate information. Such information supports decision making,
coordination, control, analysis, and visualization within the organization.
